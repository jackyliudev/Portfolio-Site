# TacoLab Website
A responsive website hosting project information and my services.

**Link to project:** <a href=https://jackyliudev.netlify.com>https://jackyliudev.netlify.com</a>


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Updated the website to showcase portfolio projects, and service information.

## Optimizations
Adjust the media query for larger screens so that some of the items are centered correctly.
Change the large background to decrease white space
Refactor code base to increase efficiently when updating site

## Lessons Learned:
I should identify areas for modularity such that codes can be reused as oppose to coming up with custom solutions every time.
